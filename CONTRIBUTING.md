Thanks for your interest in contributing to `flutter_html`!

I'm pretty busy, so in order to help me best make use of the time I spend working on this project, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

1. In general, don't submit a pull request without discussing the feature with me, in an issue, first. I don't want you to have to do a whole bunch of work for nothing. This also makes it so there won't be a whole bunch of changes I make you do in order to have your pull request merged.
2. Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/Sub6Resources/flutter_html/wiki)  before contributing (there are only two pages at the moment). This will give you an idea of what my plans are for this repository, and what you do and don't need to work on.

More specific guidelines will be added soon.
